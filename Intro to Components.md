# Introduction to PC Components
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The CPU, is responsible for executing instructions from applications and the operating system. A CPU's performance is determined by its clock speed and core count. Higher clock speeds and more cores allow for better multitasking and handling of resource-intensive tasks like gaming or video editing.

- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**: The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and 3D graphics. It offloads graphical tasks from the CPU, allowing smoother performance in applications like gaming, video editing, and 3D modeling. A GPU's performance is defined by its VRAM size and processing power.

- **Motherboard**: The motherboard connects all PC components and allows them to communicate. It determines compatibility between the CPU, RAM, storage, and GPU. Choosing the right motherboard ensures all components fit properly and can help in futureproofing your PC for upgrades in the future.

- **Memory (RAM)**: RAM temporarily stores data that the CPU and GPU actively use. More RAM enables smoother multitasking and faster performance in memory-intensive applications.

- **Storage (SSD/HDD)**: Storage devices store/save the OS or operating system, files, and applications.

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: The PSU converts electricity from your outlet into usable power for your PC components. Its wattage capacity **must exceed** the combined power consumption of your components.

- **Case**: The PC case houses all components, providing protection and structure. Cases vary in size, supporting different motherboard form factors like ATX, microATX, and mini-ITX. Selecting a case that can comfortably fit all of the components is **crucial** for the PC build and PC health.
