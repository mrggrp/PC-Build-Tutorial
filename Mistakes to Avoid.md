# Common Mistakes to Avoid when Building your First PC.
## Compatability Error.
  - Purchasing components that fit together may seem obvious, but finding out what each part is compatible with can be an exhausting process. 
  - Using a website that checks the compatiblility of parts like [PC Part Picker](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/) ensures that all parts fit together and can save you countless hours of research.
## Purchasing a poor quality PSU or power supply unit.
  - A faulty PSU can result in random shutdowns, blue screens, or no power at all.
  - Knowing how much power your PC needs, researching a reputable PSU brand, and shopping using the 80plus PSU grading system can help in choosing a good PSU.
## Forgetting to install the I/O shield.
 - An I/O shield is a thin removable metal plate that provides casing for all the inputs and outputs on the back of a PC.
 - Remembering to insert this before the motherboard and other components are placed in the casing can help you avoid having to take the whole PC apart.
## Forgetting to Remove Protective Cover.
 - Components such as the CPU cooler and motherboard come with a protective plastic covering from manufacturing.
 - The inside of a PC can get very hot, which might cause this plastic to melt and damage other components.
 - Leaving the plastic on might also cause issues with cooling.
## Proper Use of Screws and Screwdriver.
 - Over-tightening the screws can damage the PC components they secure.
 - The motherboard comes with standoffs and risers that protect the motherboard from shorting out against the metal case.
