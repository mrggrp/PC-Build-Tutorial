# How to Pick the Correct Components
- When choosing components it is important to remember that your games/applications will impact your choices.
- I have provided some great midline components below that will be able to handle _most_ applications.
- These provided parts may struggle with performance in more demanding applications like animation, modeling, and content creation.

### Gaming PC Components
- **CPU**: Choosing a processor that can handle heavy single-core performance and multitasking will allow for smoother gameplay.
  - The [AMD Ryzen 5](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-4500) and [Intel Core i5](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/intel-core-i5-13600k) are cost-effective and perform well in most modern games, thus making them good options for a beginner's PC build.
- **GPU**: With the vibrant and detailed graphics in modern games, investing in a high-performance GPU or graphics processing unit will make a huge difference in FPS, load times, and graphics quality.
  - The [NVIDIA RTX 3060](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review) and [AMD Radeon RX 6000](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-xfx) are two great midline GPUs that offer decent VRAM and great 1080p performance without breaking the bank.
- **RAM**: I recommend choosing at least 16GB of RAM for a gaming PC. Modern games demand more memory for multitasking and 16GB of RAM will prevent memory leaks and improve your systems responsiveness while playing memory intesive games.
  - Choosing a RAM kit that coincides with the official memory frequency supported by your processor is important and will save you from manual intervention.
     - For example, DDR5-5600 is the baseline for [AMD's Zen 5 chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_5), whereas DDR5-6400 is for [Intel's Core Ultra 200S processors](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/intel-core-ultra-200s-content-creation-review/?srsltid=AfmBOoq4o3HuplrLmfeVuy75oabC3eucqv7i722dKoHyWqFi1y6nwArt).
- **Storage**: For gaming I recommend using an SSD or solid state drive for storage. SSDs significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to start and load applications when compared to an HDD or hard drive disk.
  - SSDs also have the advantage of containing no moving parts, which makes them less likely to suffer from mechanical failure.
  - M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDs are the most common and fastest type of SSD. [The Sabrent Rocket 5](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sabrent-rocket-5-2tb-ssd-review) is a low cost, but high performance PCIe NVMe SSD.
    - It is important to note that SSDs vary in size between brands, so finding one that fits your case will save a lot of headache.
